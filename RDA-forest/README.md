# RDA-forest: identifying important environmental variables and adaptive neighborhoods 
[Matz & Black, 2024](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1755-0998.70002)  
**RDA_forest.R** is based on the tutorial found here: https://github.com/z0on/RDA-forest  
##  
This analysis uses additional functions which are included in **RDAforest_functions.R**  

**RDAforest.input65.Rdata** includes genetic distances (calculated from genotype matrix), coordinates, environmental data (buoy), and sample metadata

**Pairwise_over_water_distances.txt** is used as input for calculating isolation by distance  

**Rasters.Rdata.gz** are created in scripts found in [environmental_data](https://github.com/evelynabbott/bullkelp_WGS/tree/main/environmental_data)
